"Nota:"
"Les valeurs d'électricité et de vapeur dans certains tableaux sont rapportées à la fois en demandes électriques nettes et en demandes électriques brutes. Veuillez noter que la somme de toutes les colonnes pour produire des valeurs totales inclut le double comptage de certaines demandes d'énergie."
"""x"" indique que le contenu a été supprimé afin de respecter les exigences de confidentialité de la Loi sur la statistique."
"""0"" Indique que les données ont été tronquées, parce qu’elles ont été arrondies."
"-: aucune données."
