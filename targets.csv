"Note: n/a = not applicable. [A] Reported in Canada's Second Biennial Report on Climate Change (www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/second-biennial-report.html). This scenario includes policies and measures in place as of September 2015. Historical greenhouse gas emissions data from 2005 to 2013 were taken from the National Inventory Report 1990-2013: Greenhouse gas sources and sinks in Canada. [B] This scenario is reported in Canada's Seventh National Communication and Third Biennial Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/seventh-national-communication-third-biennial-report.html) and includes policies and measures in place as of September 2017. Historical greenhouse gas emissions data from 2005 to 2015 were taken from the National Inventory Report 1990-2015: Greenhouse gas sources and sinks in Canada. [C] The 2018 scenarios are reported in Canada's Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollutant Emissions Projections 2018 (www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/projections-2018.html). Historical greenhouse gas emissions data from 2005 to 2016 were taken from the National Inventory Report 1990-2016: Greenhouse gas sources and sinks in Canada. The Reference Case scenario includes policies and measures in place as of September 2018. The Additional Measures scenario includes additional measures from Canada's clean growth and climate change plan that have been announced but are still under development. [D] This value includes the 24 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent contribution of the land use, land use change and forestry sector. For more information on the projection scenarios, refer to the Data sources and methods (www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/progress-towards-canada-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction-target.html#DSM).",,,,,
